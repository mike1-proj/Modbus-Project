This file note advises how to resolve the problem on Linux OS when everything seems okay with
a USB connection but when you run a modbus read code, it returns
"Error [erno 13] could not open port /dev/ttyUSBx permission denied"

The solution is to check and see if the pc user is actually part of the Dialout group.
The Dialout is a process that controls access to comms on serial  port
Anything that wants to use a serial port on Linux for comms (Modbus for example) has to be enabled for 
access to this process by making sure the user is added to the Dialout group.

First thing is to check what  groups you have access to
To do this open terminal and type "Groups" after the $ prompt ($ groups)
the list of groups you are in is returned. 
look for dialout in the list. If its not there you need to add yourself.

To do this (with terminal still open on the command line)
Type Sudo adduser (your user name) dialout
you will now be added to the group dialout which  controls dialout access to the serial ports.

You will then have to shut down the PC and restart for the change to take aeffect.

If you type groups again in the terminal you should now see that dialout has been  added to  your group.
You are now good to go and your code or app that wants to talk out to some device will now work!
